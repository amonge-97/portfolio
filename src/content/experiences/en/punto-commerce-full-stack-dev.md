E-commerce developer using **VTEX** and **SFCC** technologies.

### VTEX
I focused on **custom development** within the platform primarily using **REACT**. Here, I created various custom applications such as:
- Branch locator.
- Countdown component for offers.
- Component to download technical specifications.

### Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud
I focused on personalizing the entire site to establish the brand's style. I also created custom components to enhance the homepage using *Page Designer*. Additionally, I developed multiple integrations such as:
- Integration with the payment method Mercado Pago.
- Integration with the payment method Conecta.
- Integration with Salesforce Sales and Service.

I also participated in the development of **APEX REST**, **triggers**, and **scheduled jobs**.
