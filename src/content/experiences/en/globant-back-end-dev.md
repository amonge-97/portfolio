**Back-End** development of **Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud** focused on integrating various external applications, creating jobs, extending custom attributes in standard objects, and creating custom objects.

I have implemented custom functionalities such as:
- Branch assignment based on customer location.
- Inventory application according to the assigned branch.
- Price application according to the assigned branch.
- Adding extra sub-products to a product (like ingredients to a food item).
- Functionality to order a product half and half (like ordering a pizza half of one flavor and half of another).

I have also worked on **Front-End** tasks to help the development team focus on fine-tuning details (pixel perfect).
