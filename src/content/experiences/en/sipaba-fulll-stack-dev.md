I participated in the development of an application to configure and manage logistics for companies (**Front-End** and **Back-End**).

The Back-End was developed with Express to extend a series of APIs necessary to handle requests from the Front-End.

The Front-End was developed with React.

The application was capable of configuring prices per meter/kilometer traveled, gram/kilogram, or volume of the package and generating quotes based on these values. The application was designed for organizations that could have multiple users with different roles.
